It calls the expensive Groq LLM API only once, saves the JSON response to a local SQLite database (GlobalTrendsCache), and serves the cached result for 24 hours. This reduces API calls for this feature by >99%.LLM Data Synthesis (Backend): Global trends are not just aggregated; they are synthesized by prompting the Groq LLM to act as a global market analyst, providing unique, high-value data to the user.Modular FastAPI (Backend): The backend is cleanly organized into utility modules (parser.py, analyzer.py, summary.py, skill_matcher.py), making the API easy to maintain and test.Full-Stack Theming (Frontend): All components, including charts and form inputs, are designed to fully respect the user's selected theme (Dark/Light/Sepia) for a seamless experience.Secure by Design: All API keys and secret files (like firebaseConfig.js and .env) are explicitly excluded from the repository via .gitignore to prevent credential leaks, following security best practices.🛠️ Tech StackAreaTechnologyPurposeFrontendReact.jsCore UI library for the single-page application.Material-UI (MUI)Component library for the modern, responsive UI.Framer MotionPowering smooth page transitions and animations.Chart.jsRendering dynamic charts on the Dashboard.AxiosHandling all HTTP requests to the backend.BackendPython 3.11+Core programming language.FastAPIHigh-performance API framework for serving all endpoints.Groq (Llama 3.1-8b)The LLM engine for all AI-powered analysis and generation.SQLAlchemyORM for database operations (specifically for the API cache).SQLiteThe database file used for the 24-hour API cache.Cloud & DatabaseFirebase AuthUser authentication (Email/Password) and management.Firestore (NoSQL)Cloud database for storing user profiles, analysis history, and feedback.⚙️ Setup & InstallationThis project uses a monorepo structure. You will need to run the backend and frontend in two separate terminals.1. Backend (FastAPI)# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Create your environment file
# Create a new file named .env in the /backend folder
# and add your Groq API key:
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" > .env

# 5. Run the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload
Your backend will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.2. Frontend (React)# 1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# 2. Install all node modules
npm install

# 3. Create your Firebase Config
# You must create your own Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
# Create a new file at frontend/src/firebaseConfig.js
# Paste your project's configuration object into it.
# (This file is in the .gitignore and will not be pushed to GitHub)
touch frontend/src/firebaseConfig.js
Your frontend/src/firebaseConfig.js file should look like this:import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

// TODO: Paste your own Firebase configuration object here
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIza...[YOUR_API_KEY]",
  authDomain: "[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]",
  storageBucket: "[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "[YOUR_SENDER_ID]",
  appId: "[YOUR_APP_ID]"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
# 4. Create your local environment file
# Create a new file named .env.local in the /frontend folder
# and tell it where the backend API is:
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)" > .env.local

# 5. Start the React application
npm start
Your frontend will now be running at http://localhost:3000 and will be connected to your local backend.
